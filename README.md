OCBC Apply done by Marcus, Jie Sheng, Herman, Jarrell and Wei Jie
# Background
At OCBC Bank, online bank account
opening services for individual accounts are available, and we hope to expand this capability
to allow joint account opening.
However, making the service available for joint accounts is more complicated than individual
accounts. For example, how would the system verify both account holders during an
application and that it isn't just one person impersonating two people? When opening a joint
account in person, both account holders must be present so that the bank officer can verify
both identities simultaneously.

## Our Solution
OCBC Apply is created for working adults who wish to open a joint account with their close ones. It is a mobile application service that allow them to create their joint account online while keeping it safe and seamless. OCBC Apply is developed to be secure and allow user to be able to make a joint account anywhere and anytime!

## Logic flow
- 1st account holder will proceed on without application code <br/>
- Fill in the form <br/>
- After 1st account holder done filling their personal details <br/>
- System will generate an application code that 2nd account holder can use to join and fill in their personal details <br/>
- After 2nd account holder done filling their personal details <br/>
- System will notify 1st account holder to proceed on the review and confirmation of joint account creation <br/>

# Some of our features

This is where the 1st account holder will fill in all their personal details for the joint account application, when they proceed to the second page, an application code will be shown. This will be the code that allows the 2nd account holder to come in the application room and enter their own details. The 1st account holder can also choose to send the code to the other person via email. Then, while waiting for the 2nd account holder to fill in all their details, the first person can actually leave the application. When the 2nd account holder is done with their part, the system will notify the 1st account holder to proceed on to the review and confirmation.
